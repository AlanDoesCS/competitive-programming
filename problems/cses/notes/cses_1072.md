## Problem walkthrough:

### Finding all possible knight positions
For a $k \times k$ board, there are $\binom{k^2}{2}$ possible pairs of knight positions.

### Finding attacking positions
Of those positions, some of which they will be attacking eachother (for $k > 3$).

As the knight moves in a $2 \times 3$ "L" shape, we need to see how many $2 \times 3$ rectangles fit on the board.

For cases where the longer side is vertical, there are $k-1$ ways to fit the rectangle along the horizontal axis, and $k-2$ ways to fit the rectangle vertically

So only considering a vertical rectangle, there are $(k-1)(k-2)$ ways to fit it in the $k^2$ board.

Notice how each rectangle contains two possible knight positions (shown as A and B) where they are attacking eachother:

```
|----|----|
| A  | B  |
|----|----|
|    |    |
|----|----|
| B  | A  |
|----|----|
```

Now to also consider horizontal orientations, we simply rotate the board, and there will be an equal number of positions.

Hence:

$$
n_\text{Attack} = 4(k-1)(k-2)
$$

### Closed formula:
We now know that:

$$
n_\text{Total} - n_\text{Attack} = \binom{k^2}{n} - 4(k-1)(k-2)
$$

Substituting in the formula for the binomial coefficient:

$$
\binom{k^2}{n} = \frac{k^2!}{2!(k^2-2)!} = \frac{k^2!}{2(k^2-2)!}
$$

Cancelling common terms:
$$
\binom{k^2}{n} = \frac{(k^2)(k^2-1)(k^2 - 2)!}{2(k^2-2)!} = \frac{(k^2)(k^2-1)}{2}
$$

Putting it back into the earlier formula:

$$
n_\text{Total} - n_\text{Attack} = \frac{(k^2)(k^2-1) - 8(k-1)(k-2)}{2} = \frac{k^4-k^2 - 8(k^2 - 3k + 2)}{2}
$$

$$
= \frac{k^4 - k^2 - 8k^2 + 24k - 16)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(k^4 -9k^2 + 24k - 16)
$$

So our result (in programmatical form) is:

```c++
(i*i*i*i -9*i*i + 24*i -16) / 2
```
